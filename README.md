# Graph_DP_Algorithms
Collection of differentially private alogrithms on graph

* Data Format
  We use the same network format with SNAP. 

* Triangle Counting Algorithms
  shiva.py implements the node differentially private triangle counting algorithm described by "Analyzing graphs with node differential privacy"

* Densest Subgraph Algorithms
  sequestial.scala implements the sequential variant of the DP densest subgraph algorithms in "Differentially Private Densest Subgraph Detection"
